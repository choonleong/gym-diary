Teaching Principles:
- Students have limited bandwidth after work. Deliver the most important part of the lesson within the first 1 hour.
- Retention is higher when students associate new information to current knowledge, hence the importance to build a good storyline from Part 1 through Part 3.
- Students learn better with experience. Therefore, Part 2 and 3 must involve hands-on activities to keep up the engagement.
- Pairing students up may help them to take courage to post their questions.
- Be comfortable with silence, let students reflect and formulate their questions during Q&A.
